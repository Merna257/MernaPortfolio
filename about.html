      <!-- Biography -->
      <p id="about-paragraph">
          Hello! Thank you for visiting. My name is Merna Saad and I am from Seattle, WA. I used to work as a Senior Team Manager and Reviser for Technical and Legal Translation (in English, Spanish, and Arabic). However, I recently decided to venture into the world of computer languages and become a software developer!

          <h2 id="programming-heading">Why programming?</h2>
          <p id="about-paragraph">
          After graduating high school with science and math electives, I faced a challenging question: Which college should I attend? Growing up In Egypt, there were social and cultural norms surrounding gender roles and women were considered unfit for programs like software engineering. Therefore, I decided to go with language arts. I graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in Mass Communication (English Department) from <a href="https://www.miuegypt.edu.eg/" target="_blank">Misr International University.</a> In addition, I obtained a professional diploma in Legal and United Nations translation from <a href="https://www.aucegypt.edu//" target="_blank">The American University in Cairo.</a> Then, I spent five years working in the translation industry, where I gained experience in adapting to new languages and various translation techniques.
          <br /><br/>

          However, I did not stop following my passion. When I heard that Stanford University offered learning opportunities via <a href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/admitted" target="_blank">free online courses in Python,</a> I immediately applied and did not think twice about it. I finished the course and noticed the similarities between human languages and programming languages. Human language can be defined as a system of spoken or written symbols that human beings use to express themselves. Over time, as languages evolved and developed, humans found a way to describe and systematize those changes. Programming languages revolve around the same principle of communication. They were created by humans as a system of symbols and rules used to communicate a set of instructions to a machine.
          <br /><br/>

          Moving forward, I decided to shift gears and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Software Development from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> online, and expect 
          to complete the program in May 2023.
